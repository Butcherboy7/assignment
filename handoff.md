## Ship Verification (2026-04-25)

### Backend API Tests — 16/16 PASSED
| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Admin login → token + role | PASS |
| User login → token + role | PASS |
| Wrong password → 401 | PASS |
| No password in login response | PASS |
| Admin GET /tasks → all 5 with populated names | PASS |
| assignedTo.name populated | PASS |
| createdBy.name populated | PASS |
| No password in task assignedTo | PASS |
| User GET /tasks → only 2 own tasks | PASS |
| User tasks all belong to user1 | PASS |
| User POST /tasks → 403 | PASS |
| User PUT task not theirs → 403 | PASS |
| Zero password leaks in task data | PASS |

### Mobile Code Review
- ✅ Login error shown inline (not just console)
- ✅ Token in AsyncStorage → survives restart (rehydrate in AuthContext)
- ✅ Role-gated navigation: user=2 tabs, admin=4 tabs
- ✅ Filter pills + search working (client-side filtering)
- ✅ useFocusEffect refreshes list on navigate-back
- ✅ User can update status (in-progress → completed), RBAC enforced server-side
- ✅ Admin can create, edit, delete tasks
- ✅ Logout clears AsyncStorage + resets auth state

## Environment Setup

### Backend (`/backend/.env`)
Already configured — contains real MongoDB Atlas URI and generated JWT_SECRET.

### Mobile (`/mobile/.env`)
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5000
```
> Find your IP: run `ipconfig` on Windows, use the IPv4 address of your active adapter (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)
1. Fix the `<BottomTabItem>` crash occurring specifically on the Web platform after login (likely an icon/navigation conflict).
2. Code review the UI changes and fine-tune any mismatched paddings across iOS/Android/Web bounds.
3. Test the built APK on a physical Android device.
